Hello, I am Özgür Ateş GeceGörür
I am a young man who is interested in software. My dream is to be a gray hat hacker.
I know a little Python, I want to learn C++ after mastering Python.
I chose github to both collect and provide information.
I'm taking software-related courses and my teachers say I'm good at it.
I know English at A1 level
and I want to become a master in cyber security
Finally, take care of yourself, stay healthy, see you
